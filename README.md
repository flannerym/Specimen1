# Early Herbaria

The Italian physician and botanist Luca Ghini began preserving plants in the 1530s.  Since plants were sources of many medicines, physicians had to identify species with healing properties, and relied on ancient texts recently translated into Latin from Greek and Arabic.  However these authors had lived in the eastern Mediterranean, and it was becoming clear that some plants they described were different from those growing further west and north.  Ghini and others concluded that to learn about these species careful observation was key:  how they grew and developed and the effects of preparations made from various plant parts.  He studied garden plants and those he gathered on fieldtrips, which were becoming more common.  But observation wasn’t enough, the visual had to be turned into text.  Notes were important in passing the information on to others:  in letters, in teaching, and in publications.

Drawings were also helpful in documenting a plant’s appearance at various life stages—budding, flowering, fruiting—because they often passed quickly.  This is where pressed plants became important.  A cutting was carefully spread out on absorbent paper, covered by another sheet, and pressed between boards, so the plant didn’t curl up as it dried.  Once dried, the plant would last indefinitely if kept from the three most common threats:  water, fire, and insects.  A label with at least the plant’s name insured that the specimen was tied to textual information.  At the time, a collection of pressed plants was called a hortus siccus, dry garden, or hortus hyemalis, winter garden for when live plant material was scarce.  The word herbarium was used more broadly for collections of plant images.

Ghini taught plant preservation to his students and fellow botanists who quickly saw its value.  He often augmented the specimens with drawings, written descriptions, and even prints taken from a published herbal on medicinal plants.  These images were in a style based on careful observation that developed in Northern Europe and then moved into the work of botanists like Ghini.  The visual was especially important since texts were reliant on ancient writers and a vocabulary for describing plant traits had yet to be developed.  Even the concepts of genus and species, which seem quite obvious today, took about two centuries to mature.

The 16th century was a time of experimentation in how best to communicate information about plants.  Ghini assisted his colleague Pietro Andrea Mattioli in interpreting an ancient text by sending him notes, specimens and drawings.  Mattioli used all these along with live plants, but disposed of the specimens after studying them.  He didn’t consider them worth saving, though he later regretted this.  The Swiss botanist and physician Felix Platter pasted one or more images on the left-hand page and a specimen of the same plant on the right, so he could easily compare them.  Others affixed them to the same sheet.  Some painted in missing parts of a plant.  Still others applied oily ink to a specimen and made a nature print of it.  While drawings are still added to herbarium sheets, the more creative approaches have not survived.  Somewhat later, embellishments were added to sheets in some herbaria to signify the status of the owner.  Printed vases and elaborate labels adorned the specimens of wealthy in 18th-century Dutch collectors.

# Carl Linnaeus and Specimens

By then, the herbarium had become an important research tool.  The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus argued that there was no substitute for it as the crucial source of information about a plant.  He tackled the problem of organizing the increasing number of species being discovered all over the world by classifying them.  He focused on the flower as having the most distinctive information, explaining why specimens are usually collected with fruit, flowers, or both.  In many species, flowers have both the male stamens with anthers containing pollen and the female pistils with egg-containing ovules.  Linnaeus divided plants into 24 classes based on number of stamens with subclasses based on pistil number.  This was considered an artificial system since species with very different overall properties were classified together based solely on stamen number.  Linnaeus had a cabinet built with 24 shelves, one for each class and kept the sheets loose so he could reclassify a species if necessary.  Linnaeus also limited species names to two words, the genus which included all species with similar properties and an epithet for each species.  Names had become longer as more species were discovered and needed to be differentiated from each other.  Linnaeus separated the name from the description, which he kept brief and succinct.
