# Early Herbaria

The Italian physician and botanist Luca Ghini began preserving pla<ts in the 1530s.  Since plants were sources of many medicines, physicians had to identify species with healing properties, and relied on ancient texts recently translated into Latin from Greek and Arabic.  However these authors had lived in the eastern Mediterranean, and it was becoming clear that some plants they described were different from those growing further west and north.  Ghini and others concluded that to learn about these species careful observation was key:  how they grew and developed and the effects of preparations made from various plant parts.  He studied garden plants and those he gathered on fieldtrips, which were becoming more common.  But observation wasn’t enough, the visual had to be turned into text.  Notes were important in passing the information on to others:  in letters, in teaching, and in publications.

Drawings were also helpful in documenting a plant’s appearance at various life stages—budding, flowering, fruiting—because they often passed quickly.  This is where pressed plants became important.  A cutting was carefully spread out on absorbent paper, covered by another sheet, and pressed between boards, so the plant didn’t curl up as it dried.  Once dried, the plant would last indefinitely if kept from the three most common threats:  water, fire, and insects.  A label with at least the plant’s name insured that the specimen was tied to textual information.  At the time, a collection of pressed plants was called a hortus siccus, dry garden, or hortus hyemalis, winter garden for when live plant material was scarce.  The word herbarium was used more broadly for collections of plant images.

Ghini taught plant preservation to his students and fellow botanists who quickly saw its value.  He often augmented the specimens with drawings, written descriptions, and even prints taken from a published herbal on medicinal plants.  These images were in a style based on careful observation that developed in Northern Europe and then moved into the work of botanists like Ghini.  The visual was especially important since texts were reliant on ancient writers and a vocabulary for describing plant traits had yet to be developed.  Even the concepts of genus and species, which seem quite obvious today, took about two centuries to mature.

The 16th century was a time of experimentation in how best to communicate information about plants.  Ghini assisted his colleague Pietro Andrea Mattioli in interpreting an ancient text by sending him notes, specimens and drawings.  Mattioli used all these along with live plants, but disposed of the specimens after studying them.  He didn’t consider them worth saving, though he later regretted this.  The Swiss botanist and physician Felix Platter pasted one or more images on the left-hand page and a specimen of the same plant on the right, so he could easily compare them.  Others affixed them to the same sheet.  Some painted in missing parts of a plant.  Still others applied oily ink to a specimen and made a nature print of it.  While drawings are still added to herbarium sheets, the more creative approaches have not survived.  Somewhat later, embellishments were added to sheets in some herbaria to signify the status of the owner.  Printed vases and elaborate labels adorned the specimens of wealthy in 18th-century Dutch collectors.

# Carl Linnaeus

By then, the herbarium had become an important research tool.  The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus argued that there was no substitute for it as the crucial source of information about a plant.  He tackled the problem of organizing the increasing number of species being discovered all over the world by classifying them.  He focused on the flower as having the most distinctive information, explaining why specimens are usually collected with fruit, flowers, or both.  In many species, flowers have both the male stamens with anthers containing pollen and the female pistils with egg-containing ovules.  Linnaeus divided plants into 24 classes based on number of stamens with subclasses based on pistil number.  This was considered an artificial system since species with very different overall properties were classified together based solely on stamen number.  Linnaeus had a cabinet built with 24 shelves, one for each class and kept the sheets loose so he could reclassify a species if necessary.  Linnaeus also limited species names to two words, the genus which included all species with similar properties and an epithet for each species.  Names had become longer as more species were discovered and needed to be differentiated from each other.  Linnaeus separated the name from the description, which he kept brief and succinct.

In 1753, Linnaeus published <em>Species Plantarum</em>, his compilation of over 6,000 plant species, while 16th-century herbals listed under a thousand.  Much of the increase came from areas investigated by European powers using their sea power to seek wealth in other parts of the world.  Their search was not only for gold and minerals, but plants with possible economic importance as medicine, timber, fiber, food, or garden plants.  The Spanish king sent his physician Francisco Hernàndez to Mexico 1570.  Since the plants were so unfamiliar, Hernandez sought assistance from indigenous healers, noted characteristics, uses, and indigenous names, while collecting specimens and drawings.  Like many early collections, Hernàndez’s herbarium did not survive; it was destroyed by fire in the king’s palace.  However, at least some of his research and illustrations were published, contributing to increasing knowledge of exotic plants.

# Plant Collecting

With time, herbaria became crucial to plant documentation.  Travelers were tutored in how to collect and preserve specimens, not easy in tropical areas where it was difficult to dry them and protect them from destruction by insects and fungi.  Sometimes seedlings or cuttings might survive, but seeds fared better, though they could lose vitality or rot.  Seeds were highly desirable items of trade among European botanists because they held so much promise.  If they germinated and flowered, there would be more seeds to share, and plants could be made into specimens, then also shared.  This is why there are herbarium specimens of tomatoes, a Latin American species, from as early as the 1550s and illustrations date from about the same period.  Other species were more difficult to grow; exotics like pineapples and bananas were known primarily from illustrations and written descriptions.

Herbaria with specimens collected before Linnaeus’s work were often neglected in the past, because the plants weren’t named according to his system.  However, these materials are being reexamined with interesting results.  In 1687 Hendrik Meyer, a Dutch collector working in Surinam, gathered specimens growing there including two African food plants:  okra and sesame, giving evidence that African enslaved persons brought to work on plantations had carried seeds with them, one of many examples of the early movement of plants with links to the slave trade. This suggests how herbaria can contribute crucial evidence on cultural and political history and reveal what had long remained hidden.

Herbaria today are examined for such hidden stories of the role of enslaved and indigenous people in the history of plant collecting.  The biota in many areas was so different from the European that collectors needed guidance in finding useful plants.  Local knowledge was essential as was the labor needed to mounting expeditions into often difficult terrain.  Yet the contributions of those most helpful often went unrecorded.  Historians and botanists are now combing records, including specimens, seeking information that collectors recorded but reach publication.  When plants were sent back to Europe, the indigenous names, if recorded, were frequently removed as being of little value.  However, combing letters, fieldnotes, and journals sometimes reveals a great deal.

Specimens can also support research on what happens to specimens after they are collected.  When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were appointed by President Thomas Jefferson to lead an expedition into the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase territory, Lewis was tutored in plant identification and collection by Benjamin Barton, a leading Philadelphia botanist.  Some of Lewis’s specimens were lost in transit, a common problem for expeditions, but many reached Barton who then asked the German botanist Frederick Pursh to study them.  Pursh became dissatisfied with his compensation and left with some of the specimens, eventually going to England, where he published descriptions of many Lewis plants.  He then sold the specimens to a British botanist whose collection was auctioned after his death, with the Lewis material going to an American botanist who donated them to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.  The remainder of the collection was left unstudied in Philadelphia’s American Philosophical Society until the late 19th century when all the sheets were reunited at ANS.  Some of this history can be read on the sheets.  A specimen of the Oregon grape is one that Pursh took to England, and has the stamp of the Lambert Herbarium.  The long-leafed sage specimen remained in Philadelphia and has the original Lewis label on blue blotting paper he used to press specimens.  Pursh had rewritten many of Lewis’s labels and then disposed of them, a rather common practice at the time.  Now every bit of information on a specimen is retained in case it might be valuable in the future.  The more recent slips tell  botanists who have examined the specimens and confirmed the identification.  Each specimen provides a microhistory of who has studied it over more than two centuries.

While economics drove much plant collecting, aesthetics also played a key role.  For many botanists, it was thrilling to discover and describe new species, especially from parts of the world where the flora was so different.  Some were interested in cultivating new plants in their gardens and sharing them with other enthusiasts.  Eventually nurseries were founded to support this work and make it profitable with beauty and novelty as drivers.  In the 17th and 18th centuries primarily the upper classes had the means to create gardens with hothouses to nurture exotic species from the tropics and have reference libraries.  Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort kept a herbarium not only for exotic species but for varieties of garden plants like anemones.  She and others experimented with growing delicate plants which they then passed on to botanists hadn’t cultivation skills.  Like Somerset, many gardeners documented their achievements with specimens.  In the 20th century, the landscape architect Beatrix Farrand created an herbarium of species grown in her Reef Point Garden; the labels recorded where each was planted, valuable information since the garden no longer exists.  Today, the British Royal Horticultural Society herbarium among others specializes in cultivated plants including new cultivars grown in their yearly trials.

In the late 18th and 19th centuries plant collecting increased significantly as not only explorers and the upper classes participated but also laborers, women, and children.  The tools for gathering plants—a tin container called a vasculum, a plant press, a loupe or hand lens—became status symbols for collectors.  Herbaria were popular for learning about plants and as symbols of that learning, which was seen as morally good, a way to appreciate God’s creations.  The poet Emily Dickinson made one while at school writing to a friend:  “Have you made an herbarium yet? . . . ’most all the girls are making one.”  Scottish baker and naturalist, Robert Dick attempted to collect all the species in the area, if not in Britain.  The British writer Margaret Gatty was middle-aged when she became enamored of seaweed, collected them whenever she could, and corresponded with experts in the field to learn more.  They in turn relied on her for specimens of species new to them or even new to science.  She published scientific journal articles and a popular guide to seaweeds; other women also bridged the gap between amateur and professional in botany.
